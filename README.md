# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
  
  We will be using Excel and VBA to help Steve with his stock analysis. we will collect stock market data from year 2017 and 2018, then code with VBA to loop through the date, then create a column to compare both years stock performances. Last we will refractor our codes into a more efficient way.
## Results
  
  After using Excel and VBA coding, we performed our analysis on 12 stocks from 2017 and 2018 stock market sheets. During year 2017, most of the picked stocks were doing well and having postive returns except ticker TERP, which was down 7.2%. The biggest return was ticker DQ, and its rerturn was 199.4%.

  In year 2018, due to the trade war; stock market was not in a good shape. Only two tickers, ENPH and RUN had positive return of 81.9% and 84%. Other 10 tickers suffered with negative returns; the biggest drop was DQ, fell 62.6%.

## Summary

  In the VBA solution code, we edited and refacotred our code into a shorter term and made it more efficent. When refactoring code, we aren't adding new functionality. More efficient mean by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for users to read. Howerver, refactoring on at the first attempts won't be esay. It needed to take a few tries to commplish.


  Refactoring in VBA required coding structure skills, because we made tiny changes on some complex code would affect the outcomes in Excel sheets. And sometimes it would get an error messege or ask you to debug. The good thing is in VBA script, it would tell you quickly which line of code contains error such as when errors found in "conditionals" and "loop".
