## Overview of Project
  
  We will be using Excel and VBA to help Steve with his stock analysis. we will collect stock market data from year 2017 and 2018, then code with VBA to loop through the date, then create a column to compare both years stock performances. Last we will refractor our codes into a more efficient way.
